Sometimes, I really care about it and pretend to be indifferent.
Sometimes, even if I feel uncomfortable, I do not want to show it.
Sometimes, I feel tired, but this is probably about growing up.
Sometimes, I think a person is cool, but I often feel lonely.
Sometimes, I feel like I let go, but I often think about it.
Sometimes, I feel so stupid.
Sometimes, when I eat alone, I may fall asleep.
Sometimes, I am often touched by a trivial matter and can not control my emotions very well.
I may seem very lively on the surface and always like to laugh, but my heart is actually very quiet.
I feel that I am not very good at expressing, so it is very hard for people to understand me.
Most people can only see how I smile.
I hope I can meet a right person, like each other.
